The first thing I have changed is the title, to reflect the company's name and the fact that this is the main website
I then went on to add HTML semantic elements in order to make the HTML more readable and more logical in its structure. Specifically, I added, "Section", "Article" and "Heading" elements - not only do these help to highlight the logical flow, the use of "Article" also means that those parts of the website (which don't necessarily need to be grouped together, but rather stand on their own, can be moved as the stylists sees fit).
I then went on to add accessible alt attributes.  I used the WCAG 2 quick reference guide from the W3 schools website as my basis for the following:
    Perceivable (Text Alternatives): I have ensured that all graphics have text alternatives
    Distinguishable (Use of Coloior, Contrast, Content Shown on Hover (psuedo classes?)): I consider that the current colour schemes and contrast allow the text to be easily read and the size of the text sufficient
    Operable (Keyboard accessible, not too many flashes, navigable): I consider that the website is reasonably operable in its current format
    Understandble (Readable, Predictable): 
    Robust (Compatible) - the website content does not seem to be compatible for use on smaller devices (a mobile phone, for example) - I "AskBCS" in relation to changing the CSS to make the website more scaleable, but the assistant didn't think that was necessary at this stage of the course (more on that later)
    In the HTML, I fixed the SEO link by creating an ID as well as class for the hyperlink to link to, as well as the CSS to link
    In the CSS, I have grouped similar classes which have the same style attributes to make the code more efficient.
